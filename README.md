# Android Workout Timer App

This repository contains the source code for a simple Android interval timer app designed for workout routines. The app allows users to create and manage multiple workout timers, each consisting of a customizable warm-up phase, a specified number of sets, and breaks between sets.

## Features
- **Customizable Workouts**: Users can create an arbitrary number of workout timers, each tailored to their preferences.
- **Audible Progress Cues**: The app provides sounds to keep athletes informed about their progress, including countdowns at the end of sets or breaks and voice announcements of completed and remaining sets.
- **Active Workout Notification**: When a workout timer is running, the app displays a notification to indicate that an active workout is in progress.

## Current Status
This project is currently on hold as I am working on another project. The app is functional but not yet complete. Key areas that need improvement:
- **Workout Display on Reopen**: While workout timers continue running in the background, when the user reopens the app, the active workout is not displayed. This feature is not yet implemented.
- **Lifecycle Management**: The lifecycle management of components needs optimization to ensure smoother operation.
